== Concept

DistributedJobManager (DJM) stores it's state in link:https://zookeeper.apache.org/[ZooKeeper] +
DJM lives withing JVM application and maintain it's own thread pool. +
DJM regularly launches user defined jobs in separate threads based on schedule. +
User defined Job is any class that implements `DistributedJob` interface. +
DJM will restart Job in case of any failure. +
DJM balance workload between Jobs +
DJM consists of two parts: Manager and Worker. Each DJM instance has active Worker.
  But only one DJM instance has active Manager. +
Master orchestrate Job between Workers in the cluster.

User defined Job should implement `DistributedJob` interface and provide information about work-items. +
Work-item is a smallest indivisible peace of work. +
Job WorkPool is a list of work-items that DJM will split between active Workers.
[code]
----
class MyJob implements DistributedJob{
    //...
    WorkPool getWorkPool(){
        return WorkPool.of(new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("workItem1", "workItem2")));
    }
}
----

Job informs DJM about WorkPool. +
DJM split work-items from WorkPool among all Workers evenly. +
If Job define WorkPool with single work-item then it means that such a job will be launched by DJM
only within single application in the cluster.

When DJM launches Job it passes information about work-items that Job should process.
[code]
----
class MyJob implements DistributedJob{
    //...
void run(DistributedJobContext context) {
    //...
    Set<String> workShare = context.getWorkShare();
    for (String workItem : workShare) {
        //process workItem
    }
}

== Getting started

=== Add dependency into your project.

.Java dependencies
* distributed-job-manager image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/ru.fix/distributed-job-manager.svg[link=https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:ru.fix%20and%20a:distributed-job-manager]

=== Launch DJM
DJM requires list of ZooKeeper hosts and path within ZooKeeper that will be used to store DJM state. +
DJM will use provided applicationId to identify application instance within cluster. +

[code]
----
//During application startup
DistributedJobManager djm = new DistributedJobManager(
    "zooKeeperHost1,zooKeeperHost2,zooKeeperHost3"
    "/zooKeeperPath/for/djm",
    "applicaiotId#3",
    Arrays.asList(new MyJob1(), new MyJob2()));

//During applicatoin shutdown
djm.close();
----


=== Monitoring and metrics
DJM expose Jobs state through profiler metrics. +
* What tasks are currently running.
* How long it took for task to complete.
* How many work items processed.
* etc.


=== Guarantees

In case of network failure one one can be temporary detached from other part of the cluster. +
In order to improve stability of the cluster and tolerate short connectivity problems
DJM allows detached Worker to continue it's work for configured amount of time. +
To enable that DJM uses persistent locks and keep information when which worker started to process particular job in ZooKeeper. +
Other Workers will not be able to process same work-items during this lock timeout even if owner of lock gone offline.
